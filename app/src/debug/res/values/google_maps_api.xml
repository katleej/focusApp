    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    B9:08:5F:CF:0A:FF:73:51:CE:66:15:4F:E6:BD:A8:CC:36:95:34:23

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    B9:08:5F:CF:0A:FF:73:51:CE:66:15:4F:E6:BD:A8:CC:36:95:34:23

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
